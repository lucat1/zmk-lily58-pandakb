# Lily58 ZMK config

This repository contains the ZMK configuration for my Lily58 split mechanical keyboard. I am using a [modified PCB from Typeractive.xyz](https://docs.typeractive.xyz/build-guides/lily58-wireless) that allows to use the keyboard wirelessly using the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) controller with [nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view/) displays.

The case is the [Manta 58/s from capsuledeluxe](https://capsuledeluxe.com/manta58/), 3D printed at the [ETH Student project house](https://sph.ethz.ch/) with some modifications! For now, I am using MX Brown switches.

This keyboard is my first own mechanical keyboard and still work in progress!
